# Age-detection-Deep-Learning-Python
Our task is preety simple, we have faces of inidian actors from https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-age-detection/#data_dictionary. Some of the pictures are not so easy to inspect personally that is why we are going to let a machine to do it. Only thing we need to make sure is that we load the date correctly, pre-process so that it can be feed to neural network. Our NN ought to predict 3 classes, i.e. if the actor on the picture middle, young or old aged is.
